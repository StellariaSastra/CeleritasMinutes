:sunny: Minutes of session :

After half an hour's wait for people to come, the session started with "Theory construction of light."

(Kausthubh enters,observes,leaves)

After a while, with three possible explanations of "light" at hand the session came to a halt and shall be continued in the near future.

Given the forum with small population, we then decided to do a rigorous session on "First law of motion".

(Kausthubh enters, observes again, and this time stars a topic which the club has never touched before)

        T  I  M  E

To begin with, the discussion was narrowed down to arriving at a 'generic definition' of a system.

Once we answered that, the following questions arose with respect to a system,

•Why do we need the concept of time? 
 [ie.How someone would have arrived at something like this, in the first place?]

• How do we know time "flows/passes" ?

• What is the rate of "flow/passage" of time?

• Can the rate be measured?

• If we wish to measure the rate of time flow, what are the requirements of a device which can be used to measure the flow ?

At which point, (though without proper setting of stage to relativity) the question of  "Is 'length contraction' a 'real phenomenon' or is it a lack of capability of any device to observe/measure it (including human eyes) ? " popped and was left to ponder .

After discussing few ideas of how earlier devices to 'measure time' could have been, the crux of whole session followed,

:anger_right: Is there any "meaning" in the above questions / does it make sense to ask those questions?

Which brought us back to the starting point, 
"Whaaat issss time ?!"

:feet:The biological aspects of 'time' that were touched upon were,

• How do we perceive the passage of time? (Do we?)

• Do all "living beings" perceive the passage of time in the same way?

• Do cells, the 'simplest' structural and functional units of 'life' perceive the passage of time ?
