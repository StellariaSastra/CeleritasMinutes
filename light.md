:sunny: Minutes of Session on Light :
(Just like any other session you are required to analyze things from the scratch, considering yourself in the first place witnessing new phenomenons)

Forbidden terms : Light,Frequency,Wave,Energy,Power....

•How people would have thought about "light"( for the sake of starting discussion) ?
•What enables us to see things?
•Is there "something" coming from our eyes?
(^This is the interesting part )
•How do we get information about the things we see?
•Do objects appear the same to everyone?
(If yes, how?If no, how?)
*Is/Are there " supreme being(s)" controlling and managing this process?!!
•Try to come up with a hypothesis that can explain the process of seeing.
°( At this point there were three process explanations, out of which one was chosen,and we tried to account the observations with that)
•Do we need to talk about medium?
•How our eyes see objects in our field of vision?
•Why do distant objects appear smaller?
•On what external factors does our ability to see depends?

¶ And we concluded by giving the name "light" to the entity that causes these phenomenons. 

.......[Of course you are free to call it "Tight", it doesn't matter]
