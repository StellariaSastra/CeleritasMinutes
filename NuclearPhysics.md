Minutes of the session held on Nuclear Physics

The session was slightly more rigorous in nature, with us wandering into mathematics and working there. Diagrams were also drawn, so kindly pardon me if the minutes aren't accurate enough, because they can never be without the diagrams and math.

So the session began with the following assumptions, for the sake of simplicity:
    1. All the four fundamental forces exist. (Gravity, EM, Weak, Strong forces)
    2. We acknowledge the relative strengths of these forces.
    3. We know nothing about the forces, but the range of action of them is of          the order of 10^-15 meters.
    4. Like charges repel. (Questions to ponder : But why? What is the meaning of a negative charge?)

The discussion continued with a thought experiment regarding the motion of charges. Conclusions were reached, and they also raised some other questions.

(Questions to ponder about later: Why is Coulomb's law an inverse square law? And why was the ESU unit discarded?)

The topic of energy arose through the course of our discussions, and raised some questions.

(Questions: Why is there a -ve sign in the K.E. formula? Why does the formula work only on conservative forces? Why does the god father have a 'fetish' for this formula? What is a field?)
We also discussed P.E. and defined it as, "The energy acquired by virtue of position."

Armed with this new tool under our belt, we decide to tackle the problem:
"What is the closest approach between two like charges of same magnitude?"

After pondering for a while, and using math, we arrived at a result.

We decided to take a small detour here, and discuss '1', which is defined as:
"The set of all elements possessing the property of oneness" 
More philosophy than math.
And as is typical with most philosophical discussions, we were left with more questions than when we started, and almost no comprehensible answers. 

The very nature of logical systems were also discussed. Again, only questions, almost no answers.

Also, someone please send Paul Lockhart's "A mathematicians lament" here.

Our detour ended here, with us returning to physics.

Nuclear fusion was discussed, and it lead to a short discussion on star formation, where we discussed the probability of a gas cloud actually becoming a star, and also the parameters governing this.

Then, we finally arrived at the topic we all were waiting for.
Assumptions:
    1. Most of mass is concentrated at the center of the atom
    2. This "nucleus" is positively charged.

Question : 
    1. Can we fuse any two nuclei together?
    2. If we can, then why does it happen?
    3. Why do heavy elements, like U form?

After this, we discussed the death of stars, and parameters which may govern the future of a star after it reaches the 'iron limit'

Note : Elements above iron fuse, while those below it fissile.

The discussion on the death of stars raised questions like, "How does land form" and "What about black hole formation"

These questions also raised the question of what the words "life" and "intelligence", given we are all just star dust.

The session thus concluded, giving us many questions to ponder about, for hours on length if we desire.

TL;DR
TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND TOO FEW ANSWERS
