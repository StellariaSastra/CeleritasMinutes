Session of 14-2-2019

The session was conducted on the topic of “Why do we need dark matter”
----------------------------------------
Kindly pardon me for using multiple words without proper definitions.  This is the first time I tried taking minutes, so I will try and meet the standards from the forthcoming sessions.
----------------------------------------
So the session started as usual, with the topic being put forth. We started off by trying to define matter. While discussing said definition, the matter of matter being related with cropped up, but no consensus was reached.
 
After a while, we started defining dark matter. While trying to define it, another question arose. 

“ How did we conclude it to be matter if we cannot detect it with the tools at hand?”

Once again, this question too did not reach a satisfactory conclusion.

The session rolled on with the assumption that dark matter exists. So the first set of queries that were raised were:

1.    What is it? (Unanswered)
2.    What is its underlying principle? i.e., how does it interact with things, if it even interacts with them at all.

The second question led to the framing of another question, being “ What does the word interaction mean?” 

multiple definitions were put forth, in the context of both matter and light. This question also raised the true meaning of “contact” between two objects, and the physical significance of zero being a distance.

After running down this rabbit hole for a while, with no avail, the godfather raised a question.

“ There is some entity X which cannot be detected currently. But it explains the phenomenon we observe. Does it mean it exists?” and also requested everyone to google the phrase, “ God of the gaps” later.

The recurring question of the requirement of a definition for “dark matter” was raised once again, to no avail.

The discussion progressed by stating some phenomena which are supposedly caused due to dark matter, being
----------------------------------------

1.    By rotational dynamics, objects closer to the axis of rotation of a disc are supposed to be traveling at faster velocities than those further away from the axis. This is true for galaxies as well, but only for a certain distance, after which the velocity of the bodies remains pretty much constant in value. 

2.    Gravitational lensing. Something about a galaxy being in front of a quasar, and 10 observations being made, at different instances of time and the telescope at different positions in space. (Nothing conclusive was said in this argument that I can remember. Kindly pardon me)

3.    The rate of expansion of the universe too was incorrectly attributed to dark matter. 

----------------------------------------

The first point was tackled with by Kepler’s second law. This lead to an analysis of Kepler’s laws, and its limits were determined as being only applicable for two bodies and when the mass of one is significantly larger than the other. Also, the topic of flatness (Euclidian and not Riemann) was briefly mentioned. 

The discussion continued by applying Kepler’s laws for the objects in the milky way and the supermassive black hole at its center.

The question of how we know the sun was moving was also raised, and Ptolemaic sphere theory was briefly mentioned.

----------------------------------------

The session concluded with a request to follow PDC. It may have its drawbacks, but it is essential to for forming the groundwork of theory construction. OG/TP was also mentioned, along with the first principle method, in hopes of using them in the forthcoming sessions.
