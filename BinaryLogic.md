what is binary system of logic
that question led to a discussion on absolute value of a statement
then the immediate question to arise was what is a statement and how different is it from a claim.
if you were to truth value to a statement what are the necessary questions that arise when it is raised.
what determines the truth value of a statement.
does it have only one truth value all the time.
answer to that question arose the topic for the day : can a statement have neither truth nor false as its truth value.

can the laws of logic be disproved?
how can you access a statement. 
on what factors do you assign the soundness and validity of a statement.
can a statement be false and logically consistent.
how can you differentiate premise from experiential claim.
why do we have a seperate set of axioms for science and mathematics.
if a statement doesn't have its truth value either true or false then how can you assign a truth  value to it?
ex: it may or will not rain tomorrow.
A: B is true 
B: A is false.
truth value of the set of statement cant be determined. as a consequence the binary system of logic was found to have some inconsistencies.
