Minutes of yesterday's  session:
( :speaking_head: Kausthubh's last  officially moderating session...,)

Having arrived at the end of this semester, the session began with sharing everyone's view about the club and their take away.
Then some 'club maintenance' issues were discussed on;

•The point of "publicity" for the club was raised, which led to the following questions :
:bee:
-Why do we need publicity?
-Is that really necessary?
-How we individually came to know about the club?
-Modes of publicity..?
 (Kausthubh put forth strongly that he doesn't want any of us to go 'class pitching', and was agreed upon)
-How will we be able to convey exactly what's happening in our club ?

At this point Karthik gave a statement that received a thunder of applause like never before and could possibly end up being engraved on the club room :

:scroll: "THE CLUB DOESN'T NEED PEOPLE , 
BUT PEOPLE NEED THE CLUB"

• Then the idea of having two club sessions a week, one for the 'newbies' and other for the regular members, was agreed upon. 
(This was to prevent prolonging and repetitive sessions)
So that each session would move on with it's own pace.
:bee:
Having still an hour in hand, under the constant pestering of mosquitoes and other insects, we tried to arrive at a topic,
at which point the discussion on "need for inertia" was brought up again.

•Then the hypothetic scenario of "race between me and an electron" was analysed;

° If an electron was to race with a human for 1m which would have more effect on the electron winning ?!
- Small dimensions (approx.10^-16 m)  [or]
-High velocity (approx.2x10^6 m/s)

And after little more talks and posing the forum dispersed.
