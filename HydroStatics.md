Minutes of today's session

Our topic for today was hydrostatics.

The following questions were discussed - 

1.What is hydrostatics?
2.What is Hydro? 
3.What is Statics?
4.What is rest?

We revisited Newton's first law to refresh our ideas on rest and uniform motion.


:eye_in_speech_bubble: New rule in club: Use any term you want, but you must provide an experiment(s)/observation(s) to prove that the word you used and the concept it represents is necessary for the discussion.

Next we moved on to discuss the properties of water.

We started with a beaker of water and puddle of water on a table.

What are the observations (not theories, explanations, hypotheses) we can list on inspection of the given set up?


1. Does transparency depend on the thickness of water layer?

2. Does water have a fixed boundary?

3. What do you observe when an immiscible substance is dropped inside the beaker of water?

4. Do "submerge" and "sink" convey the same meaning?

Then, given that the topic was supposed to lead to surface tension, we asked for observation(s) which need the concept of surface tension to be invoked for an explanation. 

The observation chosen for inspection and evaluation was the shape of rain drops. The following questions were encountered.

1.What do you observe?

2. What are the force(s) acting on the rain drop?

3. Do they balance each other? What happens when they do balance each other/don't balance each other?

4. What shape does a rain drop  acquire along it's motion? 

5. What hypothesis can be suggested/created to explain the shape of the falling rain drop without the use of surface tension?
