Minutes of today's meeting *02/08/18*

Today's session started off like a welcome session since there were many new faces(both first and second years). Rules that we follow in this club were made clear to the new comers.

Wasting no time, we moved on to the topic we decided to discuss.

1)What is a planet?

2)What are the criteria that an object should possess to be qualified as a planet?

were the initial questions asked.we had many answers. Eventually we had a "conclusive" answer for what a planet is. Before doing Planetary formation that was decided as a topic, we decided to have a recap on star formation.

Due to time constraint,we weren't  asking questions and trying to find out answers ourselves which we usually do. 
Rather we(second years) tried explaining star formation to the new comers and also answered almost all the questions that were brought up.

1)can gas clouds be homogenous?
 If so, is it homogeneity based on distribution or composition? 

were the questions put forward.
Then the moderator (Kausthubh) took it a little deeper into star formation. we were asked questions like

1)Can nuclear fusion fail to begin?
If so,what causes it to fail?
(Considering that we knew what nuclear fusion is)

2)what is the necessity for the elements to fuse with each other?
(Hint:Think about Binding energy per nucleon)

3)Do all elements undergo nuclear fusion?

Answering all the questions mentioned above,the stage was beautifully set up for planetary formation which will be discussed a bit deeper in the upcoming sessions.


P.S.:People who can design posters for the official physics club (CELERITAS) of SASTRA can design a poster and send that to me .we are happy to welcome ideas.
Is there some other way to have a repository of minutes? putting it here as msg might not be easy to read..
