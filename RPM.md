MINUTES OF THE SESSION:
DATE: 26-12-2019

TOPIC: RPM

The session concentrated on:

1. difference between rotation and revolution 
(For the study, the object under consideration is split up into constituent particles)
2. Defining rotation of a particle
3. Is inclusion of particle necessary for defining rotation in general?
4. what is RPM?
5. why RPM is needed?
6. design an experiment to measure rpm (caveman approach)

Since RPM can be rotations per minute or revolutions per minute, the session moved on to design an experiment to measure the rotations per minute of a wheel first.

Situation: there's a wheel and a shaft attached to it's center. How can the rotations per minute of the wheel can be measured?

Experiment 1:
The wheel can be enclosed within a glass and a small hole can be made on the wheel so that after each rotation a small marble ball falls down through that hole (something similar to a lottery machine)

Experiment 2:
At one point on the wheel, paint can be applied and the wheel can be made to run on a paper of some finite length. After two rotations, we will observe two paint marks on the paper. We have the number of marks and the time taken. With that, we can find out the RPM or rotations per unit time(as gaurav said)

Both of the above experiments had some flaws so the members decided to come up with a new model or make changes to the above ones in the next session.
