:clock::clock: Minutes of the session 11-10-2019 :clock::clock:
first few minutes went on recapping the concept of frame of refrence and what the role of an observer is.
scenario: consider a train and an observer in it, the train is moving at a uniform speed... a person is walking on a parallel track with a uniform velocity
1. how does the man on the track report the motion of the person on the train.
2. vice versa question
3.what does it mean to add or subtract velocities?
4. how could you measure velocities?
5. what does the speed limit board on the road mean?
6. what is the reference that they had in their mind?
7. does 40 km/hr in New Jersey mean the same as 40km/hr in Chennai?
8. how can two velocities be compared
9. is there a unified frame of reference in the earth which is used to calibrate velocity values in various regions of the world..
10.consider a thought experiment...the ground is moving under your feet..  then shouldn't we change the reference every time.. 
11. how to establish the relation between various frames of refrence?
12. can distance be relative?
13. how is relative distance different from the actual distance?
14. assuming we know the value of velocities like we did in the scenario... is calcuating distance justified when the speeds are different (time works differently across frames of references, apparently)
