Minutes of the meeting happened on:

:arrow_forward:We had planned to discuss Non Uniform circular motion. To do that we decided to discuss uniform circular motion briefly.

:arrow_forward:We encountered the following questions when were discussing uniform circular motion.

1)What is circular motion?

2)What experiment can you design to find the direction of the velocity of the object in circular motion?

3)Are there any other factors that can affect your experimental results?
If yes,How will you eliminate  those factors?

4)Do we observe any other velocity in a  different direction?

5)Is there any force responsible for the circular motion of the object?

6)If yes,How will you determine the direction of the force

7)Are acceleration and velocity interdependent?

8)Can there be acceleration without velocity?
