Kausthubh wakes up and goes to the lake near his house and sees a red boat everyday of the week.

The explanations are

Occam's Razor states that the explanation containing the least number of assumption to adequately explain a certain phenomenon must be taken into consideration over one with more number of assumptions.

What is an 'adequate explanation'?

According to Occam's Razor, which is the better theory?

Which theory has the sun and moon appearing at the same time as a consequence of the theory?

Now we discuss one theory from an article

What your take about this. 
Inference from the statements made.
How does it account for communication. 


Difference between accuracy and precision

What can the terms precise and accurate be used to describe? Data sets or devices?

Do you say that a device is precise and thus the data obtained from it will be precise or vice versa?

Device 1 measurements- 30.15,30.15,30.1,30.15,30.2
Device 2 measurements- 30.1,30.1,30.1,30.2,30

Which device is more accurate and which one is more precise?

When we mention accuracy, what do you compare the data with and how do you obtain that value?
