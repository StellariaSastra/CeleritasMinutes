:notepad_spiral: Minutes of the session on  :

     With the session aiming at further expanding the knowledge on theory constructions,
the question of "what is Rule of Inference ?" was put forth. 
.........
..........
[Silence]
..........
[still silence]
........,

So we started from crude as usual,

 •What are the types of logic?
(given that we dealt with 'what logic is' in the previous sessions)
• Examples of each type of logic
• Can method of induction be applied to 'science'?
 Answering which we got a much bigger question,
• How will you prove the "classical reduction"?
[ ie.If P then Q; given P, =>Q]
• Will truth tables work here?
• Is there a proof first of all ?! 
Which lead to the contemplation that, if some alien species 'work out logic',will they arrive at the same methodologies? 
(Validity of "Logic" itself !! :alien:)
After analysing the structure of few examples,we then agreed to call this method PDC,with
P-premise
D-derivation
C-conclusion
Based on which the following were raised,
• Are premises always 'true'?
• Is conclusion necessary?
• Can different derivations lead to the same conclusion?
Then a senior raised a point,
• If the premise and conclusion are given,can the derivation now be called an 'assumption' ?

:speech_balloon:Observing that there were still few lost minds, we identified that the concern about the 'truth/validity' was the reason. 

•Which is our concern, 'truth/validity' of the premise or that of the derivation?

:anger_right:When even that did not clear the clutter, Akash came up with his mathematical analogy for various possible combinations of PDC triplets,with mathematical operators being derivations and the numbers representing premises.
This seemed to work, but had a catch,can this be a generalised example for all PDC triplets?
(Or is that a specific case)
:inbox_tray:After this, we collected random premises to work with :-
1.)Sun rises in the east.
2.)Betel is so _(censored)*.
3.)Watches are worn on the left hand.
4.)All living things are humans.
5.)The board is white.
6.)Humans have two hands.
7.)Electronic gadget need energy.
8.)This room is filled with air.

• Can you categorize these premises into any groups? If yes, How?
• In what way premise 7 & 8 are different from the others?

If you have an answer, our next question would be what is the difference between perception and observation? 
(or are they same ??)

:outbox_tray:Here comes the naming of the classification part,

-Observational generalisations (OG)
-Theoretical propositions (TP)

We then briefed on how TPs are formed which included references to our previous sessions on light, and on motion.
While our tummies were growling, Kausthubh came with a 'good' example to further understand TPs,

"Consider you are in a completely dark room.You hear a 'meow' sound. What can you say about it?! "_

:fork_and_knife:But sadly, the 'meow' was  suppressed by the growling and the point 'Is TP dependant on OG?' was left to stand till the next session
